        Dear zPAYD User,
        <br>
        <br>
        Further to your recent credit application, this is to advise you that ZeroPayd affiliated lender approved your
        credit line for use through ZeroPayd.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is an automated notification only and does not warrant credit amount and terms as those are set
        independently by the lender. Financial Lender will follow up with required documentation and further next steps.
        <br>
        <br>
        On behalf of ZeroPayd and partners we thank you for your business and look forward to keeping you bill free.
        <br>
        <br>
        Yours truly,
        <br>
        <br>
        zPAYD Team!
        <br>
