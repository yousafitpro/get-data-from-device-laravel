        Dear zPAYD Member,
        <br>
        <br>
        Further to your recent credit application, this is to advise you that zPAYD affiliated lenders will not be
        able to extend credit to you at this time.
        <br>
        <br>
        After a thorough review of your application and the supporting documents you supplied, our lenders concluded
        that your current financial situation precludes them from extending further credit to you at this time. When
        your financial picture changes and your current level of risk-exposure becomes lower, we would be happy to
        resubmit your application.
        <br>
        <br>
        On behalf of zPAYD and partners we thank you for your understanding and look forward to serving you in the
        future.
        <br>
        <br>
        Yours truly,
        <br>
        <br>
        zPAYD Team!
